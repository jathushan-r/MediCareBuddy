{
  "When will I see a physician?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "All patients are first triaged by an ER nurse. Then patients are evaluated by a physician. Patients who have a higher acuity of illness (i.e. heart attack or stroke) may be treated before those patients with less severe conditions (laceration, sprained ankle, etc.). Your patience is always appreciated."
  },
  "When will I be able to eat?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Patients are able to eat after all their tests are completed and the physician has evaluated the results. On average, it is within three to four hours. However, it is sometimes necessary for patients to remain \"NPO\" (nothing by mouth) until further tests and/or studies are completed."
  },
  "When will I receive my pain medication?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Because pain medication can mask important clues to your medical condition, it may not be given until tests are completed and the physician has evaluated the results. However, treatment for pain is important so please let your nurse or physician know when you are experiencing pain or if there is no relief from the medication that was prescribed. You will be asked to rate your pain throughout your stay in our department and, if admitted, on our medical floors."
  },
  "How is the Emergency Department staffed?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "The department is staffed with emergency medicine physicians and nurses, physician assistants, technicians, CNAs and unit coordinators along with specialists from the laboratory, cardiology, respiratory and radiology departments"

    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Yes, usually, but the number of visitors in the emergency treatment area is kept to a minimum. Occasionally, visitors will be asked to remain in the ED lobby until your loved one is placed into the room and settled into their environment. Usually, two visitors per patient are allowed in most areas of the department. This gives the emergency team sufficient space to do their job quickly and effectively. And it ensures that patients are receiving the best medical care possible while maintaining an appropriate level of privacy. Every effort is made to keep your loved ones informed of your condition and allow them to be with you when possible."
  },
  "What happens if I am admitted?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Upon admission to the hospital, you will remain in the Emergency Department until your inpatient room is ready. Your admitting physician will visit you during their designated \"patient rounds."
  },
  "Who's the doctor in charge of me?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "You'll be cared for by a team of doctors and nurses, not your family doctor. The attending physician is your \"go-to\" doctor who understands the big picture and who discharges you from the hospital."
  },
  "What's my problem?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "The attending physician should explain things so you can understand your diagnosis and care plan. Never feel shy to ask the doctor to repeat the explanation AND to include a family member for another pair of ears. When a diagnosis is not made right away, keep asking."
  },
  "What will happen next?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Knowing the care plan reduces your feeling of being caught off guard. Ask this question each day. Keeping a diary is helpful."
  },
  "I don't like that plan. Can I choose another?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Your doctor has an ethical and legal duty to explain the other options and potential results. Again, including a family member and keeping notes may help you understand what’s been said. All patients have clear rights when it comes to care."
  },
  "Can I refuse a test or a doctor to see me?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Yes. Often a patient declines a test, operation, or a doctor because of unclear information. A conversation with the attending physician is helpful, knowing you can still decline."
  },
  "When am I going home?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "As soon as you're admitted, the attending physician estimates your discharge date. Having a goal for everyone is important. The discharge date can be changed depending on how you respond to treatment."
  },
  "What changes in medications do I have to know about?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Medication changes often cause the greatest confusion, which is why keeping a diary is helpful. It’s important to understand the final choices. Doses will be given to you in writing when you’re discharged, and the list will be sent to your primary doctor and everyone involved in your post-hospital care."
  },
  "What is my out-of-pocket cost for being in the hospital?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "A question your doctor is unlikely to be able to answer, but one that your insurance company can because the cost varies depending on your insurance. Call your insurance plan or ask a family member to do so. Doctors are interested and sensitive to this issue and many times are able to find creative ways to save costs."
  },
  "Am I being observed or admitted?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "A product of Healthcare Reform, \"observation status\" means you're expected to be discharged within 24 hours. Many insurers, including Medicare, regard observation status as Part B or outpatient services. If you’re unexpectedly in the hospital for more than 24 hours, you’re usually changed to full admission status because observation status would cost you more."
  },
  "What must I look out for after being discharged?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "You'll get specific instructions on symptoms such as fever or pain, which would be alarming enough to call your family doctor or go to the emergency room. Your attending physician will make every effort to provide your primary-care doctor with details of your hospital stay so he or she will be able to handle the majority of concerns. Ideally, immediately upon discharge, your primary-care doctor becomes the team leader."
  },
  "The phone line is busy, is there something I can do about it?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "We try to give our best service to our patients and it can get very busy from time to time.

    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Confirming your identity is a safety precaution. Anyone providing you with medical care – for example, an IV drip or a prescription medicine – must verify your identity to make sure the right patient is receiving the appropriate care. Redundant sources of information – name, date of birth, and wristband – reduce the potential for errors. The first step toward keeping you safe is each treatment team member consistently confirming your identity."
  },
  "Why does the nursing staff ask if I have to use the bathroom so often?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "This is another safety precaution. Your nurses ask you about using the bathroom as a way of preventing falls. If a nurse is present, he or she can assist you in getting to and from the bathroom. Using the restroom while alone is riskier, even for patients who are normally steady on their feet. Certain medications, for example, have a side effect of dizziness, and walking normally after certain procedures can take time."
  },
  "How can I best avoid falling?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Falls are a leading source of hospital injury, and Alpha Health does not want you to fall. The best way to avoid a fall is to call for assistance from a member of your treatment team whenever you need to get out of bed or move from one location to another. Wearing sensible shoes or non-slip socks is also a good idea. Of course, the risk of falling doesn’t end at the hospital."
  },
  "How can I keep track of my medications?": {
    "Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations.": "Drug names can be long and difficult to pronounce, but the good news is that you don’t have to be a pharmacist to accurately keep track of your medications.
