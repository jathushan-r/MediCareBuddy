# Localised Chatbot for Hospital Customer Care

## Introduction

The **Localised Chatbot for Hospital Customer Care** project is aimed at developing an intelligent and interactive chatbot system tailored to enhance customer support services for users who communicate in the native Sri Lankan languages, such as Sinhala or Tamil. This innovative chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant, offering quick and accurate information, addressing medical inquiries, guiding users through hospital procedures, and ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience.

## Objectives

### 1. Language Adaptability

The primary objective of this project is to create a chatbot that can seamlessly understand and respond in both Sinhala and Tamil languages. This linguistic fluency will enable users to interact comfortably and receive accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

### 2. Appointment Scheduling and Reminders

The chatbot will streamline the appointment booking process, allowing patients to schedule appointments conveniently through natural language interactions. Additionally, it will send automated reminders to patients about their upcoming appointments.

### 3. Personalized Patient Support

To provide a more personalized experience, the chatbot will be designed to recognize returning patients and access their medical history (with proper consent). This capability will enable the chatbot to offer tailored guidance, appointment reminders, and post-treatment follow-up instructions.

### 4. Data Privacy and Compliance

Data security and patient privacy are of utmost importance. The chatbot will be developed with robust encryption and compliance measures to protect sensitive medical information and adhere to healthcare regulations.

- **Langchain**: Langchain technology is used to facilitate language adaptability, enabling the chatbot to understand and respond fluently in both Sinhala and Tamil languages.

- **LLAMA2 Chat 7b LLM (Large Language Model)**: The chatbot leverages the power of the LLAMA2 Chat 7b Large Language Model to understand user queries, generate natural language responses, and provide personalized patient support.
