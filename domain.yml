  utter_pain_medication_info:
    - text: "Pain medication might not be administered immediately in order to avoid masking important diagnostic clues. It will typically be given after tests are completed and the physician has reviewed the results. However, if you're experiencing pain or not finding relief from prescribed medication, please inform your nurse or physician. Throughout your stay, you'll be asked to rate your pain, and if you're admitted, this will continue on the medical floors."

  utter_medical_problem_info:
    - text: "The attending physician should explain your diagnosis and care plan in a way that you can understand. Don't hesitate to ask them to repeat or clarify explanations. It's also helpful to have a family member present to ensure you catch all the details. If a diagnosis isn't immediate, keep asking for updates."

  utter_next_steps_info:
    - text: "Staying informed about your care plan reduces feelings of uncertainty. It's a good idea to ask this question daily to understand the progression of your treatment. Keeping a diary can also help you keep track of your care journey."

  utter_alternate_plan_info:

  utter_refusal_info:
    - text: "Yes, you have the right to refuse a test, procedure, or even a specific doctor's involvement. If you're unsure about a recommendation, it's beneficial to have a conversation with the attending physician to better understand your options."
